# Callbacks-in-Keras

We explain the MNIST dataset in Keras and the use of Callbacks in it's implementation. Visualize results in Tensorboard. Contents:

- **mnist_keras** : Deep Neural Network Implementation of modeling the MNIST dataset
- **notebooks** : Notebooks explaining the implementation and `Keras.callbacks.TensorBoard`.
- **mics** : Screenshots of resulting tensorboards
